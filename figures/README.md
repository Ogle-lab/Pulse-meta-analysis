### Figures

# Table 1. Description of search methods

# Figure 1. Map of sites

# Figure 2. Stacked histogram describing data (type of pulse and the number of pulses)
- needs work
- needs to be by pulses and not counts (double check it's doing this)
- make x labels prettier/ make more sense
- maybe make legend more intuitive?
- total number on top of each bar
- colors: red, purple, blue, gray or something like that where intermediate values are mixture of other colors

# Figure 3. Flowchart of how we determined pulse types
- Emma will do this

# Figure 4. Histogram? of t.peak and y.peaks for each variable
- needs work
- facet of 4 (grid)

# Figure 5. Heatmap describing glm results
- needs work
- use ggheatmap
