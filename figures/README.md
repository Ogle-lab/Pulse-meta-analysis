### Figures

# Figure 1. Map of sites

# Table 1. Tables describing data (type of pulse and the number of pulses)

# Table 2. Tables describing results

# Figure 2. Histogram of t.peak and y.peaks for each variable

# Figure 3-5. Relative influence plots for all 4 boosted regression trees

# Maybe:
# Supplement plots: Predictor plot with data and density: - don't use, only for supplement
# one for w
# one for y.peak and t.peak next to each other
# show this nonlinear relationship, but show sample size in some way
# show jittered actual y.peak and t.peak
# Probably need to extract line from boost object and do in ggplot
# double axis density plot
# color the points by the sample unit type
