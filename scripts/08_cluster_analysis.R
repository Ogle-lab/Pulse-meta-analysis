### Post-analysis cluster analysis


## Question 1: Is there a pulse
## Response variable of interest: w mean (model weight, from 0 to 1)
## Predictor variables of interest: varGroup, varType, Sample.unit, unitDuration, elev.m.wc, MAT.C.wc, MAP.mm.wc, Pulse.type


## Question 2: If there is a pulse, do t.peak (time to peak response) 
## and y.peak (magnitude of peak response) depend on the variables of interest?
## Response of interest: y.peak and t.peak mean
## Predictor variables of interest: varGroup, varType, Sample.unit, unitDuration, elev.m.wc, MAT.C.wc, MAP.mm.wc, Pulse.type


## Question 3: If there is no pulse response, do bb (intercept) and mm (slope) depend on the variables of interest?
## Response of interest: bb and mm mean
## Predictor variables of interest: varGroup, varType, Sample.unit, unitDuration, elev.m.wc, MAT.C.wc, MAP.mm.wc, Pulse.type
